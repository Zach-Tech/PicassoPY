# PicassoPY
Working with Python automation to get create "Art", small project in my early stages of learning Python.

Basically just trying to draw a smiley face on any generic painting program

The dificulty comes with XY coordinates in relation to screen posistioning.
I had written a program to output XY coordinates of mouse pos at any given time, however
the program had significant memory issues, and overall was less than ideal.
